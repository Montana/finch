# Finch 

### What is Finch?

Simply put, Finch is a Python script that communicates with Jenkins. It helps you stay in the CLI environment while running Jenkins tasks to improve workflow. Currently it's catered to Prowl.

### Usage 

If you're a Prowl employee, you need login to the Prowl VPS, and then clone the repo via 

<pre>git clone http://www.github.com/Montana/finch.git</pre>

Once Finch is cloned, you can run Finch by running

<pre>python finch.py</pre> 

You may need to chmod first, but that should be the ONLY thing you have to do.
